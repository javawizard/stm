Thinking about rewriting the core of the STM system again...

(I can't seem to find any notes/etc that I wrote on my previous attempt to rewrite the core, so I'm going to just redo everything from scratch.)

So, I imported some notes I wrote in my todo list about this rewrite of stm. They're in stm-3-notes.txt.

So...

There could be a module, stm.core, that contains the lower-level classes.

Then there could be a module, perhaps just stm/__init__ (or maybe stm.highlevel, which stm/__init__ would just re-export), that has higher level functions like atomically and such.

And TVars would be a higher level construct, as (hopefully) would TWeakRefs, so they could perhaps be in their own modules, maybe stm.tvar and stm.tweakref or something.

So let's think about the existing system and how it needs to change.

So, there's the current mechanism that, after a transaction commits, notifies vars changed that they need to retry... Hm.
